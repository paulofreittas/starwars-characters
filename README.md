# Star Wars Characters

If you are a Star Wars fan, this project is for you!
Consuming the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/), I created an interface to consult information about Star Wars characters.

### Technologies

- ReactJS
- Typescript

### How to execute?

```
$ git clone git://github.com/paulofreittas/starwars-characters.git
```

Then put the cloned directory into your `PATH`, or run `yarn` to install all dependencies.

After you finish installing all dependencies, run `yarn start` to execute project in localhost on port 3000. `http://localhost:3000/`
